Conventional Commit Message Format
A typical commit message should consist of:

Type: A type that describes the kind of change. Common types include 
feat (new feature), 
fix (bug fix), 
docs (documentation), 
style (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.), 
refactor (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature), 
perf (performance improvements), 
test (adding missing tests or correcting existing tests), 
build (changes that affect the build system or external dependencies), 
ci (changes to our CI configuration files and scripts), 
chore (other changes that don't modify src or test files),
revert (reverting previous commit).

Scope: A scope that provides additional contextual information about the change. It's optional but useful for understanding the scope of the change.
Subject: A short description of the change.
Body: A more detailed explanation of the change. This is optional but recommended for complex changes.
Footer: Information about breaking changes or issues this commit closes. This is optional.

example : git commit -m "feat(login): add JWT authentication for user login"
